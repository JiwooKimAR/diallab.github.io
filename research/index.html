      Nowadays, recommender systems have been widely used in various real-world
      services like Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, and so on. The recommender system is
      a subtask of information retrieval to predict the “rating” or “preference” of an item
      for a target user. Our research project focuses on designing and developing novel
      recommender models that consider several factors such as accuracy,
      scalability, time-awareness, interpretability, and diversity.

      NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between
      computers and humans using natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to let
      computers read, understand, and generate human-level languages. Our research goal is
      to develop the model for natural language understanding (NLU) as well as
      natural language generation (NLG).

      Machine learning (ML) is the study of algorithms and models to provide systems the ability
      to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Our research goal
      is to design more accurate and reliable models for supervised/unsupervised learning as well
      as reinforcement learning.
