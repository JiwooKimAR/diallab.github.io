        <h2>Recommender systems</h2>
        Nowadays, recommender systems have been widely used in various real-world
         services like Amazon, Netflix, YouTube, Spotify, and so on. The recommender system is
          a subtask of information retrieval to predict the “rating” or “preference” of an item
           for a target user. Our research project focuses on designing and developing novel
            recommender models that consider several factors such as accuracy,
             scalability, time-awareness, interpretability, and diversity.
        <h2>Natural language processing (NLP)</h2>
        NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between 
        computers and humans using natural language. The ultimate goal of NLP is to let 
        computers read, understand, and generate human-level languages. Our research goal is 
        to develop the model for natural language understanding (NLU) as well as 
        natural language generation (NLG).
        <h2>Machine/Deep learning algorithm</h2>
        Machine learning (ML) is the study of algorithms and models to provide systems the ability 
        to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Our research goal 
        is to design more accurate and reliable models for supervised/unsupervised learning as well 
        as reinforcement learning.
